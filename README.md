# 🌟 Chatbot with RASA and NLU Model 🌟  

**An AI-powered conversational assistant designed to revolutionize user interaction for E-commerce.**

---

## 🎯 **Business Objective**
A chatbot serves as a digital assistant, engaging users in natural conversations—whether to fetch product details, provide support, or process requests seamlessly. This project focuses on building an **AI-based chatbot** using the **Rasa NLU framework**, enabling dynamic and intelligent communication.  

**Use Case:** An E-commerce assistant capable of:  
- 📦 Providing product information (`product_info`)  
- 💰 Answering price inquiries (`ask_price`)  
- ❌ Handling order cancellations (`cancel_order`)  

---

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

### **What’s Inside?**  
- **Intents:** Understanding user goals (e.g., `ask_price`, `cancel_order`)  
- **Entities:** Extracting contextual data (e.g., `product`, `order_id`, `location`)  
- **Pipeline:** Built using **Spacy** and **TensorFlow** for robust natural language understanding.  

### **Tech Stack** 🛠️  
- **Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Libraries:** `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `rasa`, `pymongo`, `tensorflow`, `spacy`  
- **Database:** MongoDB  

---

## 📁 **Folder Structure**

### 🔹 **Input:**  
Contains training data, configurations, and sample intents/entities:  
- `data.json`  
- `spacy_config.yml`  
- `tensorflow_config.yml`  

### 🔹 **Src (Source Code):**  
The backbone of the project, containing modularized code:  
- **`Engine.py`**: The main script orchestrating all functions.  
- **`ML_Pipeline` folder**: Contains modular Python functions for:  
  - Data preparation 📊  
  - Model training 🤖  
  - Evaluation metrics 📈  

### 🔹 **Output:**  
Pre-trained models for instant deployment. No need to retrain from scratch—just load and go! 🚀  

### 🔹 **Lib (Reference Materials):**  
Includes Jupyter notebooks, reference slides, and notes for deeper understanding.

## 🛠️ **Key Features**
1. **Intent and Entity Recognition:**  
   - Captures user intent (`product_info`, `ask_price`) and extracts relevant entities (`product`, `order_id`).  
2. **Model Training Pipelines:**  
   - Supports **Spacy** and **TensorFlow** pipelines for intent classification and entity recognition.  
3. **Data Visualization & Insights:**  
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for a deeper understanding of dataset patterns.  
4. **MongoDB Integration:**  
   - Efficiently manages session-based interactions.  

---

## 📚 **How It Works**
1. 🧹 **Data Preparation**: Curate datasets from tools like [Rasa NLU Trainer](https://rasahq.github.io/rasa-nlu-trainer/) or [Chatito](https://rodrigopivi.github.io/Chatito/).  
2. 🧩 **Modular Code**: Functions are neatly organized for clarity and scalability.  
3. 🎛️ **Model Configuration**: YAML files for **Spacy** and **TensorFlow** pipelines.  
4. 🏋️ **Training**: Models trained on annotated datasets for intent and entity recognition.  
5. 📊 **Evaluation**: Confusion matrix plots to compare models and select the best one.  
6. 🤝 **Chatbot Testing**: Seamless real-time testing for robust performance validation.
